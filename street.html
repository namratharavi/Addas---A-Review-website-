Take a walk during the night through the streets of Bangalore and the pleasant aroma of the gourmet food that is prepared here every moment, is sure to leave you in awe. The lovely food prepared in the streets of Bangalore is no less tasty than the local and international cuisines at five-star restaurants. The shops here do not have good seating arrangements-agreed, but eating here in the crescent moonlight with a cool breeze for company is an experience like no other</p>
 
 <p class="start_content">Have you ever noticed how street food is never something that people outgrow? We even hear about humans outgrowing chocolate (which is rather unthinkable!) but never street food. And as an ode to the food that has everyone by the roots of their taste buds, here are 14 excellent places for street food in Bangalore.</p>
